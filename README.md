Detecting sounds using Deep Learning

This project is about classifying environment sounds using an appropraite deep learning algorithm. This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy. And a CSV file containing metadata about each sound clip is also provided.
